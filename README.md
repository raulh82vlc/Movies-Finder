# Movies Finder [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/raulh82vlc/Movies-Finder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/raulh82vlc/Movies-Finder)
Movies Finder in combination with Material design can be aligned with *Clean architecture* by means of *Model-View-Presenter (MVP)*.

## Overview
At this open-source project, it is decoupled between `android` and `domain` modules or high level layers.

This means, `android` is strongly coupled with the Android framework and `domain` is decoupled from it, and can be re-used for other purposes when
required as is purely *Java* based, but not framework coupled.

Inside the those modules, there are some good practices being employed, for instance:
- There is an implementation of the *repository pattern* with a datasource (it could be extended to have a cache datasource in the future).
The existing one is an API Rest Services data source

Moreover, by means of *synchronised requests* to the API, using `Retrofit` for this purpose and properly handling 
the different requests on threads with a pool of threads which passes their use cases result.

## Architecture design overview
The exchange between the different *layers* is as follows:
- **Repository layer**:
 - from the models coming from a concrete *data source* to the *Repository* (repository is the responsible of managing from 1 to n datasources)
 - from the *Repository* to their associated *Interactor* (or use case)
- **Interactor layer**: from the *Interactor*, which is responsible of the *business logic* to the *Presenter*
- **Presenter layer**: from the *Presenter*, which provides the final formatted info to a passive `View` from a UI element (fragments / activities). Finally, this information would be passed through the UI thread

### Material design
- Movies Finder uses a wide range of Material design widgets from the Design support library such as:
- `AppBarLayout`, `CoordinatorLayout`, `Toolbar`, `RecyclerView`, `CardView`, `NestedScrollView`, `CollapsingToolbarLayout`

### Features
- Search for a movie when a user submits a query, then a list of search results will be displayed with a thumbnail
image and title if found any
- Error handling integrated for Internet connection issues or if 0 results achieved
- Once clicked an item, the detail view of an item is shown, which shows all the specific information such as: authors,
PEG, year, ranking, votes, etc
- A secret link is hidden after the *Author* field of every specific item (it launches a link)

### SDK support
Support SDKs from **15** to **23**
